Welcome to drawFractal, a simple webapp for drawing fractals. 

Purposefully built to replicate the popular graphics program 'MSPaint'. 

To begin drawing fractals, start by drawing some lines on the page. Then,
click on the 'branches' icon at the top of the menu on the left of the page.
Click and drag anywhere on the page, and voila! You've started making fractals.
Have fun exploring.

If you've enjoyed the program, then please send me money, I've had ramen every
night for the past week and my gums are starting to bleed.
